# Using Flask-SocketIO
This application demonstrates the use of flask-SocketIO to establish a bidirectional and real-time communication between a Flask server and its application.

Specifically, this project implements a range slider that sends its value to the server each second, without submitting anything!

The applications are endless (e.g. control the volume of music, adjust the intensity of a device, etc.)

If lost, please refer to my blog [post](https://gabrielsotelo.medium.com/communicating-your-flask-server-and-app-in-real-time-bc8f0819a31c) to know what this is all about.
